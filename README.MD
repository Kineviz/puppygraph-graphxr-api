# GraphXR PuppyGraph Connector
A FastAPI-based service that enables GraphXR to connect and visualize graph data stored in PuppyGraph Database. This API service acts as a bridge between GraphXR and PuppyGraph, allowing interactive graph data exploration and visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PuppyGraph Database instance

## Installation Guide

### Setting up PuppyGraph Database, puppygraph-graphxr-service, and GraphXR Application

1. Clone the repository

2. Start PuppyGraph and PostgreSQL using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-all.yml up -d
   ```
   This command starts PuppyGraph, PostgreSQL service, and the GraphXR Application.
   It also loads the supply-chain dataset into PostgreSQL and configures the PuppyGraph instance to build a graph on top of the data.

   Note: To use your own dataset, modify the `docker-compose-all.yml` file accordingly.
